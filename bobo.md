## Flavor Text

It was a good Life in the cult of the Naked Goblins, feasts, battles for honor, generally a peaceful goblin life. One day, sunny and a chill day, until the hill giants arrived. The leader of the cult welcomed the giants, let them in, gave them food and entertaiment, but it didn't take long until the food reseves of the cult was empty, giants are hungry. The goblins of the cult had enough and begged the leader to kick the giants out of the camp. The leader feared what the giants are capable of and obeyed to them, enslaving the goblins to gather food like some footfolk. But Bobo didn't like the giants one bit and left the cult immidiatly. Bobo will return.
